1. Class Definitions
- Campaign:
  • Attributes: 
      - name (str), 
      - dayparting_schedule (list of hourly windows), 
      - status (active/inactive)
  • Methods: 
      - Check if active based on current hour

- Brand:
  • Attributes: 
      - name, 
      - daily/monthly budgets, 
      - daily/monthly spends, 
      - campaigns (list)
  • Methods: 
      - Update spends based on active campaigns
      - Check budget thresholds and deactivate campaigns
      - Reset daily/monthly budgets and reactivate campaigns

- AdAgency:
  • Attributes: 
      - List of Brand objects
  • Methods:
      - Simulate time progression (hours/days/months)
      - Coordinate budget checks and dayparting enforcement
      - Handle budget resets at temporal boundaries

2. Data Structure Initialization
- Campaigns: Organized hierarchically under Brands
  • Each Brand contains its own list of Campaign objects

- Brands: List of Brand objects managed by AdAgency
  • Each maintains independent budget tracking
  • Campaign statuses are scoped to their parent Brand

3. Core Simulation Flow 
For each simulated month:
    For each day in month:
        Reset daily budgets for all brands
        For each hour in day:
            1. Dayparting Enforcement:
               - For each Brand's Campaigns:
                 • Compare current hour to schedule
                 • Update status (active/inactive)
                 • Log status changes with rich visual feedback
            
            2. Spend Calculation:
               - For Brands with active campaigns:
                 • Generate random spend amount
                 • Update daily/monthly spend totals
                 • Perform budget threshold check
            
            3. Budget Enforcement:
               - If any budget exceeded:
                 • Deactivate all campaigns for Brand
                 • Prevent further spending
            
            4. Real-time Simulation:
               - Progress visualization with formatted hour/day counters
               - Throttled execution (1 simulated hour = 0.5 real seconds)

    End of month:
        Reset monthly budgets for all brands
        Reactivate all campaigns
