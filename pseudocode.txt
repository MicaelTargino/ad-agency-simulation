1. Define Classes:
   - Brand: Represents a brand with daily and monthly budgets, current spends, and campaigns.
   - Campaign: Represents a campaign with a dayparting schedule and status (on/off).
   - AdAgency: Manages all brands, handles budget checks, and updates campaign statuses.

2. Initialize Data Structures:
   - Brands: Dictionary or List of Brand objects.
   - Campaigns: List of Campaign objects associated with each Brand.

3. Key Steps:
   - Daily Spend Update:
     - For each brand, randomly increase the daily spend.
     - Check if the daily or monthly budget is exceeded.
     - Turn off campaigns if budgets are exceeded.
   - Dayparting:
     - Check the current time and turn campaigns on/off based on their schedule.
   - Reset Budgets:
     - At the start of a new day, reset daily spends and reactivate campaigns.
     - At the start of a new month, reset monthly spends and reactivate campaigns.

4. Simulation:
   - Run a loop to simulate real-time spend updates and status changes.
